        <h1>Hi!</h1>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>I love swimming but I can not do it much anymore because of coronavirus. I used to be on the swim team for pjcc. It took me 2 years to pass every level before I got there. I really enjoy swimming and I have developed an interest for it as I learned swimming. Now it is one of my favorite sports. I hope after the virus I can continue to swim in swim team.</p>

        <p> Well... I technically used to "work" at pjcc because I used to go to the swim team over there. But I do not really work anywhere as I am still learning and I am in school. But now, as I said earlier, I can not go to swim team right now because of the coronavirus. But, I have heard that it is starting soon! </p>

        <p> I go to the pjcc swim team. That is where I have been going for years. In fact, I went there for 2 years before going into swim team. I only got to be in swim team for a couple of months before corona struck and pjcc closed down for a while.

        <p> I only have contact with my parents and friends. I sometimes use discord to be with my friends and I also sometimes use whatsapp in order to communicate with family members. I do not have an American phone number so I can not use messages.
